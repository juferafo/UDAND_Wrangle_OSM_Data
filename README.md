# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree project: Wrangle Open Street Map data

The goal of this project is to wrangle and extract information from a human-entered Open Street Map database (OSM) programatically.
To this end, I wrote python routines that parse the large XML source file. 
In this process the validity, consistency and uniformity of the data fields are checked. 
The OSM data is cleaned, transformed and stored into a database. 
Finally, different queries are performed against the database to obtain relevant information.

### Contents

This project was developed using `Python` to clean the data and `SQL` to execute queries.
